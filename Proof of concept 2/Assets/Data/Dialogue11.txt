;Suddenly those near the Eastern Border are confronted with walls of barbed wire and bricks meant to imprison them from freedom.;0;R 
;The East German government has caught their citizens leaving their oppressive Communist country to the West for better lives,;0;R
;so the construction of a border is created overnight by Walter Ulbricht to prevent those who want to leave from doing so.;0;R

;You take the perspective of an East German Soldier who must follow the orders to build and guard the wall with your life and do anything to stop attempts to escape your country.;0;R 
;Many of your fellow soldiers believe in the cause while others believe it is a violation of human rights.;0;R 
;You have the option to report those who you believe are plotting actions against your country or join them in their fight for freedom.;0;R
